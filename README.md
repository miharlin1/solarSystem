Here is my additional code sample for the DALI dev application! I wrote this code October 2024 for my CS1 course. The assignment was to create a solar system with pre defined bodies that orbit the sun body.
Although I know we are discouraged from selecting assignments from this course, I do not have prior coding samples to choose from. I tried to make the project more exciting by adding a new feature!

The code has a "Time_scale" bar that allows the user to change the time scale of the simulation. Moving the curser over the bar and left will slow down the time scale, and moving it right will speed it up.
This addition is super cool because if you set the time_scale to be super big, you can see how the bodies eventually leave the sun's orbit!

To run this locally, you can use PyCharm and download the directory. I've included the cs1lib file that is used throughout CS1!

**Learning Journey**:
For this sample code, my learning journy will be more brief than in my project created directly for DALI application. I went into the CS1 course with very little background knowledge.
I had taken CS courses in Python in High School, but are department was very small and did not cover a lot of the material I learned in CS1. I learned how to navigate a new library, CS1lib, how to create
classes and objects, and how to implement real-world information into a coded simulation. This meant considering scale and framerate, all things completely unfamiliar to me. These were all
very challenging concepts to get behind, so I'm thankful I had clear instruction to guide my journy.

I think this project could be a great education tool with further improvement. It could help students visualize our solar system. If I had more time, I think it would be cool if the user could click on a body
and information about it would be displayed, like it's real world mass!
